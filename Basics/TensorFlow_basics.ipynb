    "### What are Random Tensors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random tensors are tensors of arbitrary size that contain random numbers. These tensors are used in various applications, particularly in neural networks to initialize weights and patterns that need to be learned from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Random Tensors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks use random tensors to initialize their weights, which are then refined through training to represent patterns in the data. This process involves taking a random n-dimensional array of numbers and updating them to represent a compressed version of the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Do Neural Networks Learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning process in neural networks involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The network starts with random patterns.\n",
    "2. **Training**: The network is trained on demonstrative examples of data.\n",
    "3. **Refining**: The network updates its random patterns to represent the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Random Tensors with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow provides the `tf.random.Generator` class to create random tensors. This class maintains an internal state that is updated every time random numbers are generated. You can create a `tf.random.Generator` object by manually creating an instance of the class or by using `tf.random.get_global_generator()` to get the default global generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of creating a random tensor using `tf.random.Generator`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "g = tf.random.Generator.from_seed(1)\n",
    "print(g.normal(shape=[2, 3]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will generate a random tensor of shape (2, 3) with random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points to Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tf.random.Generator` maintains an internal state that is updated every time random numbers are generated.\n",
    "- You can create a `tf.random.Generator` object manually or use `tf.random.get_global_generator()` to get the default global generator.\n",
    "- The `tf.random.Generator` class is used to create independent random-number streams.\n",
    "- It interacts with `tf.function` and distribution strategies in specific ways.\n",
    "- You can save and restore generators using `tf.train.Checkpoint`.\n"
